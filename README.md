Objects Detection and Text Recognitions

In this projects, I am trying to use yolov3 model to detect the targets(text) and recognition it.<br>
Training of yolov3 , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FNfRtXEbr4&t=1421s as my references. <br>


Steps of processing : <br>
1. Find out the bounding boxes of target (Done !)<br>
2. Crop it out and split into several cropped images  (Done !) <br>
3. Detect the rotation angles of target ( Done !)<br>
4. Classified them by classifier , eg : CNN or KNN or XGBoost <br>
5. Join the results <br>
